Documenting the genesis and evolution of the site tldrsales.com

My name is Steve.  I am a sales and marketing professional who enjoys learning about and tinkering with tech on the side.  I'm building out this site and using GitHub as a project management repository in the hopes that it will help someone else out there on their journey.  You can reach out to me at Steve@tldrsales.com if you have any questions or comments.
